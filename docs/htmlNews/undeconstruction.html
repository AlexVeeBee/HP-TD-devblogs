                        <span>Hello everyone! I am the leader of this project You may know me from different workshop items such as NGNT Nuclear Facility, BOEING 737, Meteor Strike. I would like to welcome you to this amazing journey. it all started with the idea that I've always wanted a harry potter world in a modern destructible environment. the books and the movies (soundtrack) of Harry Potter brought in a sense of mystery and adventure that I really sought and never found in real life. It was hard for me to read fantasy books because they were written in very poetic styles.</span><br><br>
                        <span>I was a bit of a nerd. I remember spending hours together in the library with a select few friends reading away any book I could lay my hands on. Books just seemed to open up whole new worlds to me.</span><br><br>
                        <span>I remember reading a Christmas Carol and getting lost in the England of the past, and checking my windows, exited to see if there were any ghosts. I remember reading Sherlock Holmes and getting lost in the world of cobbled streets and horse-carriages. I also loved watching Kung Fu movies set in ancient or medieval China and getting awed by that world.</span><br><br>
                        <span>Harry Potter along with other works of media, not only opened up this world for me, but growing up, re-reading and discussing things on forums also brought attention to the complex characters, their nuances and their value systems.</span><br><br>
                        <span>I remember when playing Age of Empires and getting transported to the ancient world, or watching Avatar: The Last Airbender and going into the Eastern Word of elements.</span><br><br>
                        <span>The presence of these worlds create a sense of wonder and excitement and it inspires you to make something exciting out of your life as well. It has encouraged me to travel, come out of my comfort zone, make new friends, try different cuisines and generally have an "let's explore this" attitude towards everything.</span><br><br>
                        <span>See you soon on the new exciting update!</span><br><br>

                    <span>The TGUI is a port of VGUI ( Valve's proprietary Graphical User Interface ), and i am almost done making everything and there is some bugs to iron out.</span><br><br>

        <div class="devblog-contrubitor-container-made">
            <span>Hello ! I'm LemonGrab, and this month I have been focusing on making the map for Diagon Alley.</span><br><br>
            <span>More specifically, I've worked on Ollivanders wand shop. I've chosen this approach to concentrate on a single building so I could get a feel for the atmosphere and the scale of the map, before I start planning more builds. Beside, this shop is probably the one with the most images and video references from the movies, but also video games, theme parks and fanarts. It has made my job much easier while I wasn't yet sure how I wanted everything to look.</span><br><br>
            <span>At this time, the building is almost finished, I just have to add a roof and a bunch of smaller details I didn't put in as to not clutter the space while I was working on it.</span><br><br>
            <span>The goal is to have each and every shop, house, and building be as detailed as possible. Everywhere you look should be filled with interesting things</span><br><br>
            <span>The wand choses the wizard, Mr.Potter" Well... at the moment there's no wand here, but not for long !</span><br>
